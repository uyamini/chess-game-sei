# Chess
This project brings the centuries-old strategy game into your browser, allowing players to challenge themselves or others in a game of intellect and foresight. 
The game of chess was born in India during the Gupta dynasty in the 6th century, and today, more than 1500 years later, it is played in 172 countries. 
It is known for its deep strategic complexity and has been played and enjoyed worldwide for generations. 
Our version aims to encapsulate that rich tradition in a digital format that's accessible and enjoyable for both new players and seasoned veterans.
It features a drag-and-drop interface for moving pieces and supports all standard chess rules, including castling, pawn promotion, and en passant. 
The project's goal is to provide a straightforward and enjoyable chess experience without the need to install any software, and both players playing on the same system also makes it a fun way to bond.
